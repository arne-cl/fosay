*Cascading Word Sheets* (*CWS*) is a language used to describe the dictionary of a natural or constructed language.

Every word has a set of attributes, like: number, gender, case, form, person, time, etc. A dictionary is a place where this information can be stored. CWS is an instrument to represent this info.

CWS looks like CSS:
{{{
"brother"[brəðər]
{
    lemma: "bruna";
    stem: "bruna.brother";
    real-number: singular;
    type: noun;
    number: singular;
    gender: masculine;
    persone: third;
    noun-type: common;
    case: nominative;
}
}}}
I guess only three attributes need explanation here: lemma, stem and real-number.
  * lemma is used to unambiguously define the word's meaning. To do so we need to anchor the word to a Lojban word which is always unambiguous.
  * stem is used to tie different forms of one word in the language. E.g. _"brother"_, _"brothers"_ and _"brother's"_ all will have the same stem - "bruna.brother"
  * real-number is used to define the number de facto of the word
